# Project Portfolio Controller
This project automates the consolidation and reporting of a strategic project portfolio, eliminating manual effort and ensuring real-time accuracy.

The solution was designed to optimize PMO operations by centralizing multiple project data sources into a single, consistent portfolio view, ready for executive reporting and KPI analysis.

Developed as part of a PMO transformation initiative, it enhances decision-making through visibility, standardization, and efficiency — reducing consolidation time from hours to seconds.

**Key Features**

- Automatic Data Aggregation: Merges project updates from external files into a unified portfolio view.

- Data Validation Rules: Ensures only complete and consistent data entries are included.

- Executive Dashboard Integration: Provides structured outputs ready for Power BI or Excel dashboards.

- Protected Core Logic (VBA): Prevents unintentional modification of the automation code.

- Editable Framework: Allows users to adapt templates, fields, and parameters without affecting the protected logic.
